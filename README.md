# 📘 M4 Submission – Predicting User Performance from Activity Behaviour

This repository contains our Milestone 4 submission for the course project on predicting student performance based on learning platform activity data.

## 📄 Submission Notebook

The main analysis and results are documented in the Jupyter notebook:

**`m4_FFO.ipynb`**

Please refer to this notebook for our research question, methodology, model results, and conclusions.

You can find our report in the file **``MLBD__PROJECT_M4.pdf`**.

## ⚠️ Important Note on Data

We provide an **updated version of `math_results.csv`**, which we received directly from Tom from GoGymi.
If you choose to rerun the analysis or any part of the notebook, **make sure to use our version of the data**, as it is essential for reproducing the reported results.

## ⚙️ Setup & Dependencies

To install the dependencies, we recommend using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/).
